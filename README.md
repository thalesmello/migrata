# Migrata

A system for managing SQL Database migrations.

## Objectives

Make it easy for anyone in the data engineering team to execute migrations and get notified when the migration completes.

This is going to be achieved via a Web interface that allows the user to register a SQL migration statement that will be run against a Database server.

Very early stage, does not work yet.
